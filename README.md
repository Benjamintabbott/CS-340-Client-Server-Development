# CS-340-Client-Server-Development


    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
    In this program I created the reusable Python module, animal_shelter. This module performs basic CRUD tasks. Using modules like this makes your program more maintainable and adaptable because it is reuseable and it does not need to be changed to be used for other programs and databases. In this program we use the read_all function to pull data from a .csv file and filter and display it in multiple ways. This CRUD module could also be implemented to create new entries, update entries, and delete entries from a file or database. 
    
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    
    I approach problems as a computer scientist by first understanding and planning out what it is I am tryign to do and how I want to approach the problem. With this project I read the requirements and began understanding what was being asked. I planned my course of action by separating the assingmnent into three separate parts and began my work. I started with the data table and commented out the other callback and charts. After I tested got the table working and sorting the way that I intended. I moved on to the pie chart and then to the geographical location chart. By separating the job into three tasks, I was able to test and run each task to narrow down where to find problems during testing. This is somewhat similar to unit testing I have done in other courses but inclueded running the code and seeing results visually.
    
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

    Computer scientists create applications to make handling, reading, understanding, securing, and manipulating data easier to the users. It saves the users time parsing through data and makes searching, analyzing, and understandint the data unquestionably easier for the user. The work done on this project allowed the company to comb through a large database with multiple search filters to find certain specifications that they required. This allowed quick access to the entries that they needed and saved them time and money.
